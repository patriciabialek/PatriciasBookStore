REVIEW:
Reviewed and commented the IAction in the HomeController.cs page. 
Can put JS scripts below the footer in Views > Shared > Layout.cshtml.
In the same Shared folder - _LoginPartial.cshtml is used for buttons to login and register.
In the same Shared folder - _ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml is used for JQuery responses to validate
the model states on the client side.
In the same Shared folder - Error.cshtml creates a generic error view (404).
In the same Shared folder - _ViewImports.cshtml is for tag helpers and where custom tag helpers can be created.
In the same Shared folder - _ViewStart.cshtml will be the master page for all the views within the project folder.
